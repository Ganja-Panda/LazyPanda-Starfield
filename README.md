## 1) How to Properly Report a bug for Lazy Panda if you want to help me help you:

First of all, make sure you've endorsed the project. It's the minimum requirement I ask as recognition for my work.

When reporting a bug, providing the right details ensures that issues can be identified and fixed quickly. Before submitting a full complete bug report, follow these steps to help streamline the process.

I. Verify the Issue: Before reporting, make sure the issue is caused by Autoloot and not another mod or game setting. Try these steps:

- Restart the game and check if the issue persists.
- Ensure Lazy Panda is correctly installed and up to date.

II. Gather Essential Information: To make debugging easier, collect the following details:

- A clear description of the issue (e.g., "Certain items are not being looted," or "Quest items are being taken incorrectly.")
- When the issue occurs (specific quest, area, or interaction).
- Game version and mod version being used.

III. Create a new save with normal settings toggled, turn off the game.

Edit your StarfieldCustom.ini adding these lines:
[Papyrus]
bEnableLogging=1
bEnableTrace=1
bLoadDebugInformation=1


IV. Launch Game and Load your save

- Open Lazy Panda’s Terminal menu and toggle the items you want.
- Enable Looting.
- Wait a few minutes there will be no notification. 3 or 4 minutes is good.
- Quit Game
- Go to My Documents\My Games\Starfield\Logs\Script\
- Zip those files
- Attach the zip file to the post.
V. Turn off Papyrus Logging.
Providing this information ensures the issue is addressed as quickly as possible. Thanks for helping improve the mod!

[Shadedness](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Shadedness?gameId=4187) for creating Shades Glowy Stuff without this I would have miss "A LOT" of stuff.
